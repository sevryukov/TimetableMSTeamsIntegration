# How to run the completed project

## Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:

- The [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your development machine. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with .NET Core SDK version 2.2.401. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
- A Microsoft work or school account.

If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can [sign up for the Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program) to get a free Office 365 subscription.

## Register a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center

## Configure the sample

1. Initialize the [.NET development secret store](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) by opening your CLI in the directory that contains **GraphTutorial.csproj** and running the following command.

    ```Shell
    dotnet user-secrets init
    ```

1. Add your application ID and a list of required scopes to the secret store using the following commands. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the application ID you created in the Azure portal.

    ```Shell
    dotnet user-secrets set appId "YOUR_APP_ID_HERE"
    dotnet user-secrets set scopes "User.Read;Calendars.Read"
    ```

## Build and run the sample

In your command-line interface (CLI), navigate to the project directory and run the following commands.

```Shell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
